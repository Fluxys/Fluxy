# Fluxy

Howdy! I'm Fluxy, a passionate fivem scripting developer.
I have been developing scripts now for many countless years, however I mostly enjoy Javascript.

I'm proficient in LUA aswell as Java, I still have yet to create a fivem resource in Javascript, although I will get down to it at some point.

# Upcoming Projects

Expect for there to be many projects coming your way.
I plan to have a very advanced framework for people to use for their server.
